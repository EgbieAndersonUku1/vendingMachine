I recently applied for a freelance position contract. After getting past the initial first stage. The first of four stages I was offered a small 
programming task for the second stage in order to validate my problem solving skills and Python skills. The task is stated below.

### Problem requirements

A company has hired you to build a command line interface (CLI) for a virtual vending machine that must be programmed in Python.
The vending machine must be able to keep a record of the items in stock such as  'Item id', 'Price', 'Quantity', 
'Item name'. The vending machine must also give a receipt after every transaction has been made. It must display a 
different menu for employees and students. 

Do not use an external database or internal database such as SQLAlchemy, sqlite, MYSQL, etc to store data because we 
want to see how you use data structures.

The above requirement is a must and must be added to virtual vending machine but free feel to add any  extra features 
you want to the virtual vending machine, in fact we hope you do.
